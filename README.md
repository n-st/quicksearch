quicksearch: a minimalistic webservice providing search abbreviations straight from any browser's address bar
=============================================================================================================

You've configured your browser to have search abbreviations for all your
most-used search engines and other useful sites.  
`woa velocity of unladen swallow` and there you are at [Wolfram
Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=velocity+of+unladen+swallow).

But what if you're using a friend's/colleague's browser without all that
convenience?  
`quicksearch` to the rescue: a tiny Python script that is programmable in the
same way â€” except it runs as a webserver and is thus usable from any browser
anywhere. (If you've got a domain to run it on, that is.)

That query from above would become something like `qrs.ovh/woa/velocity of
unladen swallow`. Not quite as convenient as your in-browser keywords, but
certainly faster than typing `wolframalpha.com` and waiting for 3.4 MB of
website to load just so you can type in your query.

There are publicly accessible instances at [qrs.ovh](http://qrs.ovh/) and
